I am a postdoctoral university assistant at the Institute of Theoretical Computer Science, Graz University of Technology, working with [Prof. Robert Legenstein](https://www.tugraz.at/en/institutes/igi/people/prof-legenstein/). I am also co-affiliated with the TU Graz - SAL Dependable Embedded Systems Lab, Silicon Austria Labs, Graz, Austria. My research is focused in the domain of machine learning for robust artificial intelligence tools, and statistical signal processing with biomedical applications.

Before joining TU Graz, I received my Ph.D. degree in April 2020 from Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA, under supervision of [Prof. Deniz Erdogmus](https://web.northeastern.edu/deniz/). Prior to that, I obtained my BSc. and MSc. degrees from Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey, under supervision of [Prof. Mujdat Cetin](http://www.hajim.rochester.edu/ece/people/faculty/cetin_mujdat/).
