I am a research group leader at the [Chair of Cyber-Physical-Systems](https://cps.unileoben.ac.at) at Montanuniversität Leoben in Austria, since April 2024. My research is focused in the domain of robust, secure and efficient deep learning algorithms for reliable artificial intelligence systems, and statistical signal processing with biomedical applications.

Prior to joining MU Leoben, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Institute of Theoretical Computer Science](https://www.tugraz.at/en/institutes/igi/home/), Graz University of Technology, working with [Prof. Robert Legenstein](https://www.tugraz.at/en/institutes/igi/people/prof-legenstein/). I received my Ph.D. degree from [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu) (Boston, MA, USA) under supervision of [Prof. Deniz Erdoğmuş](https://web.northeastern.edu/deniz/), and my M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees from [Sabancı University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en/) (Istanbul, Turkey) under supervision of [Prof. Müjdat Çetin](http://www.hajim.rochester.edu/ece/people/faculty/cetin_mujdat/).
