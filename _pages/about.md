I am a postdoctoral university assistant at the Institute of Theoretical Computer Science, Graz University of Technology, and also co-affiliated with the TU Graz - SAL Dependable Embedded Systems Lab, Silicon Austria Labs, Graz, Austria. My research is focused in the domain of machine learning for robust artificial intelligence tools, and statistical signal processing with biomedical applications.

I received my Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA, under the supervision of [Prof. Deniz Erdogmus](https://web.northeastern.edu/deniz/). Prior to that, I obtained my BSc. degree in Electronics Engineering with a minor in Mathematics, and MSc. degree in Electronics Engineering from Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey, under the supervision of [Prof. Mujdat Cetin](http://www.hajim.rochester.edu/ece/people/faculty/cetin_mujdat/).
